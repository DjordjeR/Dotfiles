# Raja Config

This repository contains my personal configurations and utility scripts used to set up and manage my development environment.

By leveraging [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/), configuration files and scripts are easily managed, deployed, and version-controlled across multiple systems.

## What’s inside

- Dotfiles and configs for various tools and environments (e.g., `nvim`, `zsh`, `sway`, `waybar`, and more)
- Utility scripts for automation and setup

## Getting Started

Use Bombadil to install and manage your dotfiles with minimal effort:

```bash
# Get the dotfiles from this repository 
chezmoi init --apply djordjer

# Check the status
chezmoi status

# Check diff
chezmoi diff

# Apply changes 
chezmoi apply 
```
